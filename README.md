### No more useless commit messages!

Are you tired of diffuse and unclear commit messages? Do you wish everyone could wrirte as perfect and beautiful commit messages as you? Well now you CAN! 

Tell all known commit cullprits of this repo and make them install this functional and if I say so myself, _perfect_ commti template.

After installing this template the previoulsy lousy-written commit messages will (from now on out) be replaced with __detailed__, __descriptive__ and __*Well formatted*__ commit messages.

Never let anyone make you read horrible commit messages ever agian!

### How to install 

1. Clone Repo  
  `git clone https://github.com/Gurran/commit-template.git`
  
2. Run installer  
 `cd commit-template && sudo sh install.sh`
2. Done!
